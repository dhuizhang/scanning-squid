Measurements
============

The measurements that have so far been implemented for :class:`microscope.Microscope` and :class:`microscope.SusceptometerMicroscope` include

- capacitive touchdown
- initial approach of the sample
- scanning at a given height over the plane of a sample

Touchdowns
----------
Capacitive Touchdowns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Approaching the Sample
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Acquiring a Plane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO::
    Implement and document :code:`get_plane()`.

Susceptibility Touchdowns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO::
    Implement and document :code:`tc_susc()`.

Scanning
--------

See :ref:`/examples/ScanPlaneExample.ipynb` for a demonstration of scanning a plane with a :class:`microscope.SusceptometerMicroscope`.
